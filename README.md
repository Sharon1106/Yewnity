# Application Description

The idea behind yewnity is a place to go and learn about others and events that you may want to get involved with. The code design behind it involves a few more aspects. We used React, sequelize, node.js, html, css, javascript, bootstrap, cloudinary,, express-session, bcryptjs and mongoose database. The user can go on our landing page, learn about the project creators and scroll to the bottom to link onto different pages for organizatios and volunteer opportunities. Once they create a profile, they have access to a feed that is live where they can store bits of information, they have accesss to an events page where they can create events, a profile page where they can upload a profile page and update their information.
